# Getting Dressed & Ready for Work



I go back into my bedroom and **open up** my **closet** door.

> 

I have about 30 dress shirts, 10 pairs of pants, **a half-dozen** ties, and some sweaters, suit jackets, and t-shirts.

> 

I **pull out** a clean pair of socks and underwear, and then decide which shirt I'm going to wear today.

> 

I'm terrible at **colour coordinating**, so I usually bring my wife in **at this point** to help match my shirt and pants.

> 

I put on my belt with the silver buckle and **polish** my shoes.

> 

I put my cell phone and car keys in my front pocket, and my wallet in the back one.





I put on my glasses and check myself in the mirror to make sure I look okay, and then go into the home office to get my bag.



I used to carry a more traditional **briefcase**, but now I just use my computer bag to hold my laptop and my papers.

> 

Now it's back into the kitchen to grab my **Thermos** on the way out the door.

> 

I lock the door and then hurry to my car in the **garage**.

> 

I'm usually **running late** and today is **no exception**!
