# At My Desk, on Break and at Lunch





On my way to the office, I was thinking about what I have on my agenda today.



When I get to my desk, there is a stack of new memos and papers in my inbox.



When I turn on my computer, I see at least two-dozen emails I need to go through.



Just as I start in on the email, my phone rings.
