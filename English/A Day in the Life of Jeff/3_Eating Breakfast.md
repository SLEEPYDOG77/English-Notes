# Eating Breakfast



I walk into my kitchen and turn on the **coffeemaker**.

> **coffeemaker** : 

I always put the coffee, **filter**, and water in the night before so it's ready to do.

> filter : 

Next, I open the door of the **cupboard** where the **cereal** is stored.

I would love to have **ham** and eggs for breakfast every morning, or maybe **a stack of** **waffles**, but the truth is that I just don't have the time to cook.

So, I pour myself **a bowl of** cereal and put in a glass of **skim milk**, making sure I take a **spoon** out of the **silverware** **tray**.

I go outside and **pick up** my newspaper, and sit down at the kitchen table.

I love reading the paper in the morning, through usually I just have time to read a few of the stories.



When I've finished my cereal, I **grab** a banana and maybe **make a slice of** **toast** with **jam**.

I **rinse off** my breakfast dishes in the sink and put them in the **dishwasher**.

By that time, my coffee is ready so I **pour myself a cup** and put the rest in a Thermos for work.
