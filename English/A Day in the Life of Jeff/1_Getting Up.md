# Getting Up



The worst part of the day for me is definitely when I **have to** get up.

**Waking up**, that I can **handle**.

But **getting up**? That, I hate.

**The covers** I have on my bed are heavy, mostly because I have a **comforter** as well as a **light blanket**.

I sleep with two pillows, which for some reason have different colour pillowcases.

Well, at least the sheets **match**.

I sometimes wake up before the alarm **goes off**.

I like to keep the alarm at a low volume, with some classical music, **nothing too jarring**.

My old roommate used to like the terrible **buzzer** that you find on most alarm clocks **nowadays**, which always used to **drive me nuts**.

As I was saying, I sometimes wake up before the alarm, usually because of some noise outside the house —— a car door **slamming**, an alarm **going off**, **gunfire** —— well, okay, not gunfire, but man, is my neighbourhood noisy!

Of course, when I'm staying in a hotel, it's usually easier to just **get a wake up call** from the hotel than set the alarm.

I'm not really **an early riser**, so I don't **jump out of bed** ready to **take on the world**.

I get up very slowly, usually **one foot on the floor at a time**.

**Every once in a while** I'll **oversleep**, but not too often.

I really love the weekends, when I can **sleep in**.
