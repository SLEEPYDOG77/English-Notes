# Cleaning Up



I go into my bathroom sometime around 6:45 `a.m`. 



My **sink** and **medicine cabinet** are on the left when you enter my bathroom.

> sink : 
>
> medicine cabinet : 

The **toilet** is next to that, with the **tub** in front.

> tub : 

Anyway, I turn on the lights, and try to find the **mouthwash** in the medicine cabinet.

> mouthwash : 

I **pour a small amount** into a cup, **swish** it around for 30 seconds, **gargle**, and **split**.

> split : 

Not pleasant, but necessary.



Then I **get out** the **floss**.

When I'm done flossing, I **pull out** the **toothbrush** and the **toothpaste**.

I brush and then **it's off to** the shower.

I **pull** the shower curtain **aside**, **step into** the tub, and pull the curtain back.

> pull aside :

> step into : 

I turn on both the hot and the cold water, looking for the perfect temperature.



I **lather up** with soap, put some **shampoo** in my hair, then **rinse** and **dry off**.

Now it's shaving time. 



I used to own **an electric razor**, but I found it didn't **shave close enough**.

So now I'm back to the old **hand razor**.

> hand razor : 

I **lather up** with **shaving cream**, and I start to shave.

I **rinse** the razor and throw the **disposable** **blades** in the **trash**.

It's about 7:00 AM, and **I'm on to** breakfast.
